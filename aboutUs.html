	A food truck is a large motorized vehicle, such as a van or trailer,quipped to cook, prepare, serve, and/or sell food.[1][2] Some, including ice cream trucks, sell frozen or prepackaged food; others have on-board kitchens and prepare food from scratch, or they heat up food that was prepared in a bricks and mortar commercial kitchen. Sandwiches, hamburgers, french fries, and other regional fast food fare is common. In recent years, associated with the pop-up restaurant phenomenon, food trucks offering gourmet cuisine and a variety of specialties and ethnic menus have become particularly popular.[3] Food trucks may also sell cold beverages such as soda pop and water. Food trucks, along with portable food booths and food carts, are on the front line of the street food industry that serves an estimated 2.5 billion people every day.
